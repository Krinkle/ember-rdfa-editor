Introduce custom `select-node-forward` and `select-node-backward` commands with included support for atomic inline nodes. The commands are adapted from the [prosemirror-commands](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-commands) package.

These commands are tied to the `delete` and `backspace` keys respectively.
